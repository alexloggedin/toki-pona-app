This is a list of all official words in toki pona as described on the pages from
1 to 12, arranged alphabetically. Each word is listed with different meanings
depending on which parts of speech it can be used as.

The "adjective" definition applies to both adjectives and adverbs, as the only
difference between the two in toki pona is if they apply to nouns or verbs.

A noun word can always be used as an adjective with the meaning "of [noun]". For
example, "moku soweli" can mean "animal food" or "meat", depending on context.
