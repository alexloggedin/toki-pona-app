            "lesson": "\n## Spelling and Punctuation\n\nThe language *toki pona* only uses 14 letters of the Latin alphabet, and all of\nthese letters have consistent pronunciations. \n\nThese are: a,e,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,s,t,u,w.\n\nYou might have noticed that all these letters are lowercase. This is because all\ntoki pona words are spelled in lowercase, even at the start of sentences.\n\nThe consonants (j,k,l,m,n,p,s,t,w) use the same sounds as those in English, with\nthe exception of \"j\", which instead sounds like the English \"y\".\n\nThe vowels (a,e,i,o,u) are a bit more complicated to explain (but simpler to\npronounce). Unlike English, every vowel uses the same sound in all words. If you\nknow how to pronounce the vowel sounds in Spanish, Japanese or Esperanto, then\nyou can pronounce them the same way in toki pona.\n\nFor examples of English words with corresponding pronunciations:\n\n* **a** sounds like the \"a\" in the word \"far\" or (in some dialects of English) \n  the \"u\" in \"up\" or the \"a\" in \"bath\".\n\n* **e** sounds like the \"e\" in the word \"bet\".\n\n* **i** sounds like the \"i\" in the word \"bit\" or \"ee\" in \"wee\".\n\n* **o** sounds like the \"o\" in the word \"or\". \n\n* **u** sounds like the \"oo\" in \"oops\" or \"moon\".\n\n> #### info\n> The \"International Phonetic Alphabet\" (IPA) is a common way to write\n> down specific pronunciations of words and phrases in any language. \n>\n> It uses a version of the Latin alphabet with lots of additional characters\n> added. For example, the IPA pronunciation of the English word \"language\" is\n> /ˈlæŋɡwɪd͡ʒ/, but in toki pona, every single letter's pronunciation _is_ its\n> IPA symbol! So \"toki pona\" is pronounced /toki pona/.\n\nSince there are so few sounds, the way they can be pronounced can be very\nflexible. For example, some might substitute the sounds \"p,t,k\" with \"b,d,g\".\nSuch a shift would cause a lot of ambiguity or confusion in other languages, but\ntoki pona's sounds were chosen to be common to many languages and easy to\ndistinguish.\n\nAll toki pona words are pronounced with stress on their first syllable.\n\n## Basic Structure\n\nLet's start with the most basic sentence structure in toki pona:\n\n> [noun] li [noun / adjective].\n\nIn English, this would mean:\n\n> [Noun] is (a) [noun].\n\nor \n\n> [Noun] is [adjective].\n\nFor example:\n\n> ona li suli. - (He/she/it/they) is (big/great/important).\n\nAs you can see, a single word can have multiple related meanings. In practical\nusage, both \"ona\" and \"suli\" will be more clear based on context.\n\n> kili li pona. - (Fruit/vegetable/mushroom)(s) (is/are) good.\n\nAnd in this case, it doesn't make a lot of sense to use any meaning of \"pona\"\nother than \"good\".\n\nThere is an exception to the rule. If the subject is \"mi\" or \"sina\", then it is\nnot necessary to add the word \"li\". So, instead of\n\n> sina li suli. - You are important.\n\nit's\n\n> sina suli. - You are important.",

            "lesson": "To define subjects and adjectives more clearly, you can add extra words as\nadjectives. In toki pona, an adjective that modifies a noun stands after the\nnoun in question. This is unlike English, where adjectives go before nouns, but\nsimilar to French. So, for example:\n\n> jan wawa -- strong person\n\nMany of the nouns covered before can also function as adjectives. For example,\nthe pronouns \"mi\", \"sina\" and \"ona\" can serve as possessives.\n\n> mama mi -- my parent\n\n> soweli sina -- your animal\n\n> moku ona -- his/her/their food \n\nIn addition, adjectives can function as nouns:\n\n> wawa sina -- your strength\n\n> suli ona -- his/her/their greatness/size\n\n> #### info\n> Of note is the phrase \"jan pona\", which literally means \"good person\", but is\n> widely (and officially) accepted to also mean \"friend\".\n\nSeveral adjectives can be added at once:\n\n> soweli lili suwi -- cute pet (\"little animal\")\n\nHere are some example sentences that demonstrate this:\n\n> mama mi li pona. - My parents are good.\n\n> kili suwi li moku pona. - Sweet fruits are good food.\n\n> jan utala li wawa. - The warrior (\"fighting person\") is strong.\n\n> jan lili mi li suwi. - My children (\"young people\") are cute.\n\n> soweli lili li wawa ala. - Little animals are not strong.\n\n> #### warning\n> It is worth noting that the particle \"li\" is only removed if the subject is\n> just the word \"mi\" or \"sina\".

Everything in this entire heading is\n> one big \"dialectal difference\", and the author's opinions on the differences\n> will follow.\n\nThere are two commonly used ways to specify the topic of conversation when using\nthe word \"toki\".\n\nThe simpler one, as it was used in \"o kama sona e toki pona!\", is to specify\nthe topic as an adjective:\n\n> ona li toki meli. -- They talk about women.\n\nHowever, it introduces uncertainty when actual adjectives that apply to \"toki\"\nare introduced. Does \"toki ike\" mean \"speak badly\" or \"talk about evil\"?\n\nThe official book is rather unclear on the subject, but it uses \"toki e ijo\" to\nmean \"communicate things\" and \"toki wawa\" as \"testify\" (\"speak strongly\"),\nrather than \"talk about strength\".\n\nThe extended version of this approach, as also commonly used in the toki pona\ncommunity, is to use the topic as an object:\n\n> sina toki e kala. -- You talk about fish.\n\nWhile this is sometimes considered a rather unconventional use of the particle\n\"e\" for some, it is less ambiguous and more flexible. For clarity's sake, this\noption will be used throughout the course.\n\n## Example sentences\n\nAnd here's some sentences that use interesting phrases.\n\n> jan pali li toki utala e tomo mi. - The worker criticizes (\"talks in a\n> fighting way about\") my house.\n\n> ona li toki ike e jan pona mi. - They (insult / speak bad things about) my\n> friend(s).\n\nYou can put several verbs and several objects into one sentence by adding extra\nparticles \"li\" or \"e\" followed by their verbs or objects.\n\n> meli li toki e soweli, e waso. - A woman is talking about land animals and\n> birds.\n\n> jan pali li pona e ilo, li lukin e lipu. - A worker fixes the device and looks\n> at (reads) a document.\n\n## Phrases\n\nThe word \"toki\", when used by itself, is a common greeting:\n\n> toki! -- Hello!",

(\"You are good for me.\")\n\n> #### warning\n> Since \"tawa\" can be both an adjective and a preposition, certain phrases can\n> be ambiguous. For example, \"tomo tawa mi\" can mean both \"my car\" and \"a house,\n> from my perspective\". The specific meaning will depend on context.\n\nAnd here are some examples of the location words:\n\n> waso mute li lon sewi. -- Many birds are in the sky.\n\n> mi awen lon tomo mi. -- I am staying in my house.\n\n> mi toki tawa jan sewi. -- I speak to a (deity/angel/someone divine/(possibly\n> literally) man in the sky).\n\n> mi tawa kepeken noka mi. -- I am moving on foot (\"using my legs\").\n\n> kiwen lili li lon noka mi. -- A small rock is below me.\n\n> mi tawa lon poka sina. -- I walk beside you.\n\n> jan poka li ike tawa mi. -- I don't like my neighbor.\n\n> poka mi li pakala. -- My hip/side is broken.\n\n> ona li lon monsi sina. -- They are behind you.\n\n> jan utala mute li lon sinpin mi. -- Warriors are standing in front of me.\n\n> lipu suli li lon sinpin ni. -- An important document is on this wall.\n\n> sinpin ona li pona lukin. -- Their face looks good.\n\n## Phrases\n\nThere are two different ways to say \"goodbye\". If you are leaving, it's:\n\n> mi tawa! -- Goodbye! (literally \"I'm going.\")\n\nIf someone else is leaving, it's:\n \n> tawa pona! -- Goodbye! (literally \"Good movement!\")\n\nIn fact, a lot of words followed by \"pona\" are used as greetings.\n\n> moku pona! -- Bon appetit! / Have a nice meal! (literally \"Good food!\")\n\n> lape pona! -- Good night! / Sweet dreams! (literally \"Good sleep!\")\n\nThere is also a phrase that functions as many positive expressions, from \"thanks\" all the way to \"peace be upon you\":\n\n> pona tawa sina! (literally \"Good to you!\")\n",

            "lesson": "## Vocabulary notes\n\nThe word \"anpa\"'s different verb meanings sound mutually exclusive, but the\nactual meaning changes depending on what word follows after that.\n\nIf \"anpa\" is used as a verb with \"e\" and an object following it, then it\nmeans \"to conquer\" or \"to defeat\":\n\n* jan wawa li anpa e jan utala ike. -- The strong person defeated the bad\n  warrior.\n\nHowever, if \"anpa\" is used without an object, or with a preposition like \"tawa\",\nthen it means \"to bow down\":\n\n* jan pali li anpa tawa jan lawa. -- The worker bowed down to the boss.\n\nBy itself, the word \"anu\" means \"or\":\n\n> ona li pona mute anu ike mute. mi sona ala. -- It is (either) very good or\n  very bad. I don't know.\n\n## Interjections and commands\n\nThe word \"a\" functions like a emotional interjection, used to emphasize or add\nemotion to the sentence. It is usually either added at the end of a sentence or\nfunctions as a sentence on its own.\n\n> sina suwi a! -- You are so cute!\n\nMore specifically, laughter is indicated with the sentence \"a a a!\" (ha ha ha!).\n\nThe word \"mu\" substitutes for any sound made by any animal.\n\nThe word \"o\" is used to address people and issue commands.\n\nWhen used on its own at the beginning of a sentence, it turns the rest of the\nmessage into a command.\n\n> o kute e mi! -- Listen to me!\n\nWhen used after a noun phrase, it addresses a person.\n\n> sina o! -- Hey, you!\n\n> jan ale o! -- Everybody!\n\nBoth uses can be combined.\n\n> jan pali o, kepeken e ilo awen! -- Worker, use protective equipment!\n\n## Questions\n\nThere are two ways to ask questions in toki pona.\n\nIf you want to ask a yes-or-no question, you phrase the sentence normally, but\nreplace the word being questioned with a \"[word] ala [word]\" structure.\n\n> sina pona ala pona? -- Are you okay?\n\nThere are no words for \"yes\" and \"no\", so to answer positively, you repeat the\nword being used, and to answer negatively, you add \"ala\".\n\n> pona. -- Yes.\n\n> pona ala. -- No.\n\n(From what I understand, this structure is similar to what is used in Mandarin.)\n\n> ona li pali ala pali? -- Are they working?\n\n> jan lili li moku ala moku? -- Are the children eating?\n\nAlternatively, you can add \"anu seme\" (\"or what?\") at the end of the sentence\ninstead.\n\n> sina pona anu seme? -- Are you okay?\n\nFor freeform questions, you start with a regular sentence and insert \"seme\" into\nthe part you want to ask:\n\n> sina pali e seme? -- What are you (doing/working on)? (\"You work on what?\")\n\n> jan seme li pakala e ona? -- Who broke it? (\"What person broke it?\")\n\n> ijo ni li seme? -- What is this thing? (\"This thing is what?\")\n\n> sewi li laso tan seme? -- Why is the sky blue? (\"Sky is blue because of what?\")\n\n## Names (unofficial words)\n\nSo far, these pages only relied on native toki pona words to refer to things and\npeople. But this is clearly not enough when you need to call someone by their\nname. For proper names, toki pona uses so-called \"unofficial words\". These are\nusually names of people, cities, countries, etc., taken from their native\nlanguages and adapted to toki pona's pronunciation rules. Unlike all toki pona\nwords, they're spelled with the first letter capitalized.\n\nUnofficial words are always treated as adjectives, which means that before them\nis always a noun or a noun phrase describing what is being referred to.\n\n> jan Mimi -- (the person) Mimi\n\n> ma Kanata -- (the country) Canada\n\n> toki Inli -- (the language) English\n\n> ma tomo Napoli -- (the city) Naples\n\nAlternatively, the unofficial words can actually be used as adjectives:\n\n> jan Kanata -- a Canadian person\n\nSince there are multiple ways of matching native names to toki pona sounds,\nthere may ultimately be several different unofficial names for the same city or\ncountry's name. (Although there are dictionaries that include lists of toki pona\nnames for countries, cities and languages that people can use.)\n\nAlso, people speaking toki pona are free to pick their own personal toki pona\nnames, either by adapting the name from their native language or coming up with\nsomething new.\n\n> ### info\n> As you might have noticed, personal names are prefixed with \"jan\". People in\n> the toki pona community may refer to themselves with their toki pona name even\n> when using other languages, in which case they'll still add \"jan\" at the\n> beginning.\n>\n\n> #### warning\n> While this isn't the most correct option, it is okay in most cases\n> to not use unofficial words and just pronounce or spell the name how you would\n> do in your (or their) native language. For example, you can refer to a person\n> named Robert as \"jan Lope\" _or_ \"jan Robert\".\n\n## Examples\n\n> o toki ala a! -- Shut up! (\"Don't talk!\")\n\n> sina pali ala pali e ni? -- Did you do this?\n\n> mi jan San. mi lon ma Mewika. -- I am John. I live in the United States.\n\n> nimi sina li seme? -- What is your name?\n\n> jan lawa mi li ike mute. -- (My boss / our leader) is very bad.\n\n> jan Lopin o, toki! -- Hi, Robin!",

            "lesson": "Time to introduce two other particles in this language: \"pi\" and \"la\".\n\n## pi\n\nThe word \"pi\" works by grouping several adjectives or adverbs together.\nNormally, all modifiers in a phrase apply to the first word. For example:\n\n> jan wawa -- strong person\n\n> jan wawa ala -- no strong people\n\nIf you need to say \"weak people\", you need to negate \"wawa\", but not \"jan\".\nThat's where \"pi\" comes in handy:\n\n> jan pi wawa ala -- weak person/people (\"of no strength\")\n\nThis also goes with other words:\n\n> jan wawa mute -- many strong people\n\n> jan pi wawa mute -- very strong person/people\n\nIt is also useful for using common phrases:\n\n> jan toki utala -- a speaker warrior \n\n> jan pi toki utala -- a critic\n\n> #### info\n> If you prefer using the \"toki [adjective]\" structure for describing topics of\n> conversation (see [page 4](4.html) for that), then \"pi\" would also be used for\n> specifying topics that use several words:\n>\n> > sina toki pi ma tomo mama sina. -- You talk about your hometown.\n>\n\nIncluding phrases that use unofficial words.\n\n> ma tomo Wasintan li ma tomo lawa pi ma Mewika. -- (the city of) Washington is\n> the capital (\"main city\") of the United States.\n\n> #### warning\n> While \"pi\" is often defined as similar to the English word \"of\", its usage is\n> different. It is only necessary when you're grouping several words together.\n> So, for example, \"the language of good\" is still \"toki pona\", rather than\n> \"toki pi pona\".\n\n## la\n\nThe word \"la\" allows to combine two sentences to form conditions and introduce\ncontext.\n\n> [sentence A] la [sentence B].\n\n> In the context of [sentence A], [sentence B].\n\nIn the most common case, translates to something like:\n\n> If/when [sentence A], then [sentence B].\n\nFor example:\n\n> moku ni li pona la mi pana e ona tawa sina. -- If this food is good, I'll give\n> it to you.\n\n> ona li moli la ni li ike tawa jan ale. -- If they die, it will be bad for\n> everybody.\n\nBut there are also other uses. It can replace \"lon [phrase]\" when talking about\nlocation or time (more on that in the [next page](10.html):\n\n> o kalama ala lon tomo lipu. -- Be quiet in the library.\n\n> tomo lipu la o kalama ala. -- In the library, be quiet.\n\nIt can also introduce perspective, much like \"tawa\":\n\n> ni li pona tawa mi. -- This is good for me. / I like it.\n\n> mi la ni li pona. -- (From my point of view / In my opinion), this is good.\n\nOr be used to link multiple sentences:\n\n> tan ni la... -- Because of this, ...\n\n> ni la... -- In the context of all this, ...\n\n> #### info\n> The usage of \"la\" is very flexible, and some people use it for cases other\n> than those described before. Since toki pona is a very context-sensitive\n> language, the most important rule is just \"try to get your point across\".",

            "lesson": "## Pre-verbs\n\nTime to cover the last grammatical feature of toki pona: pre-verbs. These are\nwords that are added before other verbs and modify their meaning.\n\nThe word \"kama\" is used both as a regular verb to mean \"to come\" and to express\nthat something is a current event:\n\n> mi jo e moku. -- I have food.\n>\n> mi kama jo e moku. -- I (got / am getting) food.\n\n> mi kama tan ma Losi -- I come from Russia.\n\nAs a pre-verb, the word \"ken\" functions much like the English word \"can\":\n\n> mi pali e tomo. -- I work on a house.\n>\n> mi ken pali e tomo. -- I can work on a house.\n\nIt can be used on its own to mean \"possibility\", \"ability\":\n\n> ni li ken. -- This is possible.\n\n> ken la ale li pona. -- Maybe everything is okay.\n\nThe words \"open\" and \"pini\" express that the action is beginning or ending.\n\n> mi open pali e tomo. -- I start working on a house.\n\n> mi pini pali e tomo. -- I stop/finish working on a house.\n\nThe word \"sona\" by itself can mean \"knowledge\" or \"to know\", but as a pre-verb,\nit means \"know how to [do the action]\":\n\n> mi sona pali e tomo. -- I know how to work on a house.\n\n> mi sona e ni. -- I know this.\n\n> mi sona sitelen. -- I know how to write/draw.\n\n> mi sona e sitelen. -- I know a writing/picture.\n\n> ona li sona ala sona e toki Inli? -- Do they know English?\n\nWhen \"kama\" is added before \"sona\", you get a phrase that means \"to learn\":\n\n> jan lili li kama sona toki. -- The child is learning how to speak.\n\n> mi kama sona e toki pona. -- I am learning toki pona. \n\nor alternatively:\n\n> mi kama sona toki kepeken toki pona. -- I am learning how to speak in toki pona.\n\nThe word \"wile\" is used to express want or need for the following action or\nthing.\n\n> jan lili li wile moku. -- The child (is hungry / wants to eat).\n\n> jan lili li wile e ijo musi. The child wants a toy (\"amusing thing\").\n\n> wile sina li suli mute. -- Your needs/desires are very big.\n\nIn addition to these words, the words \"awen\" and \"lukin\" can also be used as\npre-verbs. \"awen\" as a pre-verb means \"to keep/continue [doing something]\" and\n\"lukin\" means \"to look for, to seek, to try [to do something]\".\n\n> ona li lukin e lipu. -- They are reading a book.\n\n> ona li awen lukin e lipu. -- They are still reading a book.\n\n> mi jo e tomo. -- I have a house.\n\n> mi lukin jo e tomo. -- I'm searching for a house (to own).\n\n## Time\n\nThe word \"tenpo\" is useful, because it's at the basis of many phrases that allow\none to define time at which something is happening. Since toki pona doesn't have\ngrammatical tenses, the way time is generally described is by using an\nadditional phrase:\n\n> tenpo ni la mi moku. -- (Right now, ) I eat.\n\nor \n\n> mi moku lon tenpo ni. -- I eat (at this time).\n\n(As explained in [page 9](9.html), such uses of \"lon\" and \"la\" are\ninterchangable in other cases as well.)\n\nThe phrases \"tenpo pini\" and \"tenpo kama\" are commonly used to mean \"past\" and\n\"future\".\n\n> tenpo pini la mi pali e ijo ike mute. -- I did a lot of bad things in the\n> past.\n\n> tenpo kama la o moku ala e kasi ni. -- In the future, don't eat this plant.\n\nOf course, you can ask questions regarding time by using \"tenpo seme\":\n\n> tenpo seme la sina pini e pali sina? -- When will you finish your work?",

            "lesson": "## Numerals\n\nThe most basic numerals in toki pona are these words:\n\n* ala - 0, nothing\n* wan - 1\n* tu - 2\n* mute (many) - 3 or more\n* ale (all) - everything, endless\n\nThis is, quite obviously, a very limited system. But it is not unique to toki\npona: languages from some hunter-gatherer societies stop their numerals at\nthree, two or even one. (In fact, the Pirahã language is reported to only have\nhad words for \"small quantity\" and \"large quantity\", the values of which change\nbased on context.)\n\nHowever, there is also a second, additional system that is officially defined,\nand commonly used, to describe larger numbers. It repurposes some of toki pona's\nwords as additional numerals:\n\n* ala - 0\n* wan - 1\n* tu - 2\n* luka (hand) - 5\n* mute (many) - 20\n* ale (all) - 100\n\nIn this system, words are added or repeated in order to form numbers. For\nexample, 42 is \"mute mute tu\" (20+20+2) and 18 is \"luka luka luka tu wan\"\n(5+5+5+2+1).\n\nAs you can see, this is still a rather limited system. Just to name the year in\nwhich this page was originally written (2020), it would require one to repeat\nthe word \"ale\" twenty times and add one \"mute\" at the end.\n\nThese limitations are all part of toki pona's philosophy of simplifying thought\nand avoiding unnecessary detail. Some people have tried coming up with other\nnumeral systems, but none have found widespread acceptance.\n\n## Using numerals\n\nRegardless of the specific system, numerals are treated as adjectives and added\nat the end of nouns or noun phrases:\n\n> soweli wan -- one animal\n\n> waso lili tu -- two small birds\n\nFor ordinal numbers (first, second...), the word \"nanpa\" followed by the number\nis used.\n\n> jan nanpa wan -- first person\n\n> tomo nanpa mute luka luka wan -- 31st house (or house #31)\n\nThe phrase \"nanpa wan\" is sometimes used along with adjectives as a superlative\nmodifier:\n\n> nena (Ewelesu/Somolunma) li nena suli nanpa wan lon ma ale. -- Mount\n> (Everest/Chomolungma) is the largest mountain in the whole world.\n\n## The calendar\n\nIn combination with \"tenpo\", the words \"suno\", \"mun\" and \"sike\" are commonly\nused to describe periods of time:\n\n> tenpo suno -- day (\"sun time\")\n\n> tenpo pimeja -- night (\"dark time\")\n\n> tenpo mun / tenpo sike mun -- month (\"moon time / moon cycle\")\n\n> tenpo sike / tenpo suno sike -- year (\"circle time / sun circle time\").\n\n## nanpa\n\nIn addition to being used for ordinal numerals, the word \"nanpa\" itself can mean\n\"number\" or \"digit\". For example,\n\n> ilo nanpa -- calculator (\"number device\")\n\n> nanpa pona -- score/points (\"good numbers\")\n\nOf course, one has to be careful then, because using actual numerals in this\ncase would be confusing. For example, would \"ilo nanpa tu\" mean \"second tool\"\nor \"two calculators\"? In the latter example, reshuffling the words into \"ilo tu\nnanpa\" could work.\n\n## Weather\n\nWhen talking about weather, the commonly used sentence is \"[noun] li lon\", which\nliterally means \"[noun] exists\" and translates to \"It is [noun]y\". Examples:\n\n> suno li lon. -- It is sunny.\n\n> telo sewi li lon. -- It is rainy. (\"Sky water\" exists.)\n\n> seli li lon. -- It is warm.\n\n> lete li lon. -- It is cold.\n",
